# Rainfall

As a developer, you might have to work on softwares that will be used by hundreds of
people.

You have learned to develop more or less complex programs without taking security
into account.

With this project, you will realize that your programs are full of breaches that can be
easily exploitable by some malicious users. But here’s good news: you can avoid them
very easily!

Once you’re through with this project, not only will you have avoided these pitfalls,
but you will have a clearer understanding of the RAM. And this will really help you
design a bugless program!
